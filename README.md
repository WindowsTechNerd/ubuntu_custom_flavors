# ubuntu_custom_flavors

This repo aims to give more capibilitys of ubuntu but having our own custom flavors

Some weird, some people want

I am giving away the iso's to the public since I won't really have any use of them.

Might take a while to publish the first release even tho I have it

Note that all iso's are made with Cubic.
