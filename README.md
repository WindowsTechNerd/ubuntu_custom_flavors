# Ubuntu custom flavors

This repo aims to give more capibilitys of ubuntu but having our own custom flavors

Some weird, some people want

I am giving away the iso's to the public since I won't really have any use of them.

You can also get the iso from archive.org at https://archive.org/details/ubuntu_custom_iso, I recommend using a downloader like FDM (Free Dowmload Manager)

Also please use archive.org since I don't have a web seed yet and sometimes my surface pro and my host is not seeding, this line shall be removed once I have a web seed.

i should also be seeding from 8 am to 9 pm in my time zone (sydney) but on weekdays, start from around 3 pm, but still end at 9 pm

Note that all iso's are made with Cubic.
