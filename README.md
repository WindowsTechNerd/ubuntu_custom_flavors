# Ubuntu custom flavors

This repo aims to give more capibilitys of ubuntu but having our own custom flavors

Some weird, some people want

I am giving away the iso's to the public since I won't really have any use of them.

You can also get the iso from archive.org at https://archive.org/details/ubuntu_custom_iso, I recommend using a downloader like FDM (Free Dowmload Manager)

Also please use archive.org since I don't have a web seed yet.

There is no fixed routtine of when i seed, but my phone seeds almost 24/7.

Note that all iso's are made with Cubic.
