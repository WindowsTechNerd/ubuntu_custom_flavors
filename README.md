# ubuntu_custom_flavors

This repo aims to give more capibilitys of ubuntu but having our own custom flavors

Some weird, some people want

I am giving away the iso's to the public since I won't really have any use of them.

It would also be amazing if you could seed sometimes till I get the iso uploaded on archive.org, can't find a good time, too slow.

Note that all iso's are made with Cubic.
