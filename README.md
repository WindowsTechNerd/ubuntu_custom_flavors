# Ubuntu custom flavors

This repo aims to give more capibilitys of ubuntu but having our own custom flavors

Some weird, some people want

I am giving away the iso's to the public since I won't really have any use of them.

You can also get the iso from archive.org at https://archive.org/details/ubuntu_custom_iso, I recommend using a downloader like FDM (Free Dowmload Manager)

Note that all iso's are made with Cubic.
